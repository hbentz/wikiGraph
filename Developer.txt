Currently developing this engine using the windows python 2.7.10 distro

This is to ensure compatibility with Snap.py (http://snap.stanford.edu/snappy/index.html)

The goal is to create a graph of wikipedia to solve the supreddit /r/degreestohitler

Currently working with the enwiki-20150602-oages-articles.xml as a source

The uncompressed file is far to large for disribution (~52GB), have a torrent file instead.

It might still be useful to pre-process the xml data as parsing this much data into a graph via pipeline may be prohibitively expensive

Once a complete graph has been created it will included in this git
